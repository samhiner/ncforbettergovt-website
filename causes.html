<h1>CURRENT PRIORITIES</h1>

<details>
	<summary>Ending Lame-Duck Power Grabs</summary>
	<h2>The Problem</h2>
	<p>After an election, but before the winners officially take their office, there is a period of time called the lame-duck session, when the old legislators who may have lost their elections are still in office. Passing legislation during this time is a normal part of the political process. But recently, legislators from the losing party have begun using the lame-duck session to pass bills that weaken the power of incoming officials from the opposing party. This is an antidemocratic practice. Lame-duck power grabs undermine the will of the people by taking away their ability to choose which elected official fills what role. In these situations, the outgoing legislature, which has lost the mandate of the people, can arbitrarily move powers around to effectively undo the results of the election.</p>
	<p>This recent trend of lame-duck power grabs started after the 2016 elections in our home state of North Carolina. In 2018, more state legislatures across the country also attempted lame-duck power grabs. This will only worsen unless we take action to stop it from becoming the new norm in our state and our country. Both Democrats and Republicans agree: lame-duck power grabs are bad policy that hurt our democracy.</p>
	<h2>Our Work</h2>
	<p>We have had 17 meetings with legislators to discuss these issues. X have agreed. Legislation is set to be introduced this summer.</p>

	<h2>Our Work</h2>
	<p>We are part of a larger coalition of nonprofits and lobbyists pushing for the passage of SB35, a bill that would raise the minimum marriage age to 16 ane require emancipation for minors to get married. Our phone bank generated 40 calls in support of ending child marriage. We also created phone call guides utilitized by other coalition members. We also attend coalition meetings and participate in determining legislative strategy for the coalition.</p>

<h1>PREVIOUS CAUSES</h1>
<details>
	<summary>Keeping Traffic Laws Safe</summary>
	<h2>The Problem</h2>
	<p>Car crashes kill millions of people each year. Researchers found that a bill to change driver licensing laws could significantly increase traffic fatalities, but the bill still passed the state senate. The bill was intended to provide flexiblity to families during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
	<h2>Our Work</h2>
	<p>We mobilized a local high school to push their state senator, a sponsor of the bill, to change the bill to be less dangerous for drivers. We connected the researchers with lobbyists and state legislators, informing them of the problems with the bill and advocating for compromise legislation. Our efforts paid off when a compromise was reached that both increased flexibility for families during the pandemic and would not cause a long term increase in car crashes.</p>

<h1>WHAT IS A LAME-DUCK POWER GRAB</h1>

<p>The concept of a democratic election is simple. The people choose the best candidate to represent them in office, and this person takes office and assumes the role that they ran for. This is what we expect of our democracy, but recently, this principle has been attacked by lame-duck power grabs.</p>

<blockquote style='font-style: italic;'>“If they are changing the rules because a person is in a different party, that would be a situation where I would question the validity of it,” said Oregon state Sen. Bill Hansell, a Republican.<br><br>

Maryland state Sen. Cheryl Kagan, a Democrat, said the moves undermine public confidence in government. “It’s just crazy,” she said. “This is a valid legislative conversation that should be had during a regular session — not a lame-duck one.”<br><br>

Arizona Senate President Pro Tem John Kavanagh, a Republican, agreed. “It’s a poor way to govern,” he said.<sup><a href='https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/blogs/stateline/2018/12/07/lame-duck-power-grabs-escalate-unsettling-trend'>[1]</a></sup></blockquote>

<p>This is why NC for Better Government is taking action. We are pushing the NC General Assembly to pass legislation banning lame-duck power grabs in North Carolina.</p>

<h1>Our Plan</h1>

<p>Election season is a critical time for our organization. We have to make sure that our legislators running for re-election know that the people of North Carolina will not accept lame-duck power grabs in government. The way to gain the support of the legislators is by building wide, grassroots support for ending lame-duck power grabs among their constituents. By calling, sending an email to, or meeting with your legislator, you are letting them know that this is an issue that their constituents care about.

After the 2020 elections are over, the real work begins. Our organization will work with legislators who are with us in opposition to lame-duck power grabs to create legislation to address this issue. Again, grassroots support will be the key to success. Legislators must know that their constituents back home are watching their votes on legislation to end lame-duck power grabs.

Our end goal is to get legislation ending lame-duck power grabs to pass the General Assembly in the 2021-2022 session. Once we reach our goal, we will continue advocating for a better democracy in North Carolina by supporting other nonpartisan, good-government proposals that the people of North Carolina believe in.</p>
