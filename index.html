	<h1>What We Do</h1>
	<p>We inform constituents around North Carolina about the danger that lame-duck power grabs pose to our democracy and help them get in contact with their state legislators to advocate for good-government measures. If you are interested in helping to end lame-duck power grabs in North Carolina, join us to make a difference.</p>

	<h1>Our Cause</h1>
	<p>We want to end lame-duck power grabs in North Carolina. Lame-duck power grabs are when after an election, but before the winners take office, the outgoing state leglislature weakens the powers of offices that were won by people of the opposite party. By doing this, they are undermining the will of the people, and this poses a danger to our democracy for Democrats and Republicans alike. Go to our <a href='issues'>Issues page</a> for more details.</p>

	<h1>How to Make a Difference</h1>
	<p>Groups of constituents advocating to their public officials have gotten change time and time again. When you call, email, or meet with your state legislator to take a stance on an issue, they listen to what you have to say and you really can change their mind. Legislators want to serve their constituents, and by giving them your opinion on an issue, you are telling them how they can serve you. So the best way you can help end lame-duck power grabs is by advocating to your state legislators. To make a difference in under a minute, <a href='takeaction#email'>send an email to your state legislators</a>. Or do more by <a href='takeaction#join'>joining us as a member</a> to spread our cause and advocate for your democracy on a more regular basis.</p>
