	<h1>Our Goal</h1>
	<p><b>We want to end lame-duck power grabs in North Carolina.</b> In 2016, after Roy Cooper was elected to be the Governor of North Carolina, the state legislature (controlled by the opposing party) passed, and the previous Governor signed. a bill to weaken the office of the Governor before Cooper took office. By doing this, the legislature and the Governor undermined the will of the people, invalidating their choice of Cooper for Governor by changing what the office did immediately after he on the election.</p>
	<p>This is not just a partisan problem. Any party that is about to lose power can do this, and it hurts our democracy, taking away the power to choose our elected officials from all of us. To prevent either party from undermining the will of the people in the future while still enabling the legislature to change the power of the Governor and other officials when necessary, we aim to stop the state legislature from making changes to the powers of the Governor and other officials during the lame-duck session. That way, any changes that are made will apply no matter what party the next elected Governor comes from, and the people are able to vote for the best candidate for the office that the candidate will actually take, not an office that will be substantially weakened if their choice opposes the desires of the current state legislature.</p>

	<h1>What We Do</h1>
	<p>We inform constituents around North Carolina about the danger that lame-duck power grabs pose to our democracy and help them get in contact with their state legislators to advocate for good-government measures. If you are interested in helping to end lame-duck power grabs in North Carolina, join us to make a difference.</p>

Legislators want to serve their constituents, and by giving them your opinion on an issue, you are telling them how they can serve you. So the best way you can help end lame-duck power grabs is by advocating to your state legislators.
