                        <strong>Our Story</strong><br>
                        NC for Better Government is a non-partisan organization dedicated to mobilizing constituents to advocate to their state legislators in support of ending lame-duck power grabs. Sam Hiner was captivated when he learned about lame-duck changes in the powers of elected offices. Sam researched the issue and knew it could be solved with legislative action. In an effort to make a change, Sam spoke to state legislators and while as a Senate Page, advocated for solutions to the issue. However, Sam realized to make real change, he would need the support of local citizens across NC, telling more people about the problems posed by lame-duck office changes. Knowing of Mick Tobin’s success with running a non-profit organization and their experience working together to organize local blood drives, Sam approached Mick about making a change. Together, they created an organization to educate and mobilize citizens in NC on lame-duck power grabs. This became what is today NC for Better Government.

                        <strong>Sam Hiner</strong><br>
                        Sam is the Founder and President of NC for Better Government. In this role, he works with state legislators to build support for our mission and develop policy, codes the website, and recruits and manages volunteers.
                        <br /><br />
                        Sam is a senior at the North Carolina School of Science and Math in Durham, NC. There, he serves his fellow students as the President of the Student Senate. Sam is also a Co-President of his school’s All Politics is Local Club, which conducts outreach between his school and the state legislature.

                        <br /><br />
                        Sam is passionate about using his time to do as much good as possible. He believes that he can have the most impact by helping end extreme poverty, which he pursues through the Borgen Project, and by pushing for good-government reforms, which is why he started NC for Better Government.                    </div>
