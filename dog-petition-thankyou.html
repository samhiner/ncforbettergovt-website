	<p>Our end goal is to get the state legislature to pass a law keeping unsecured dogs out of truck beds statewide in 2023. We've found that the best tool to convince legislators to push our bill forward, rather than letting the bill sit and die before getting a vote, is widespread support from their home district. While we have made progress driving across North Carolina convincing cities and counties to pass ordinances to keep dogs out of truck beds, there are only so many people we can reach. Your financial support enables us to reach more people through digital ads, informing them about the issue and helping them reach out to their state legislators.</p>
